    Managing Your Page on GCM
</h4>
<p class="regText">
    You will need a logo, graphics plus an “about” that illustrates your organization’s purpose.
    You will have an administrative page to upkeep all this and more information.
    GCM will keep a running total of your fundraising dollars. Disbursement will occur approximately every 30 days.

<h4 class="sectionTitle">
    Shipping
</h4>
<p class="regText">
    Funnel Shipping is another shipping method GCM uses. It saves the customer on shipping costs by doing a bulk ship
    order. If the customer chooses "Funnel Shipping" at checkout, the Craftsmen will be notified to hold the orders. Once enough
    orders have been received, the Craftsman will fulfill the order and send to the funnel leader for distribution.
</p>
<p class="regText">
    If you will be participating in funnel shipping, a funnel leader will need to be designated. It is your
    responsibility to upkeep the funnel leaders and their contact information. It is the funnel leader's responsibility to upkeep the pickup locations and verify
    products
